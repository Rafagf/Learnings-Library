<a name="mirroring"></a>
## Mirroring
During a conversation, the idea is repeating the last few words of the last thing the other person said. This will encourage the other person to further explain their thoughts, giving you a lot of context without getting into confrontation or telling the other person where you land on. 

<a name="labelling"></a>
## Labelling
Verbal observations of feelings to remove negative emotions or reinforce positive ones. e.g "It sounds like you want the best for everyone". There's a practice exercise that is a super interesting: the interviewer gathers tons of data about the other person without asking a single question, just by using mirroring and labelling.

## Mastering Delivery
The way we deliver our words makes a big difference. *DJ Voice* to calm down people. *Assertive voice* should be the default one to keep a happy/collaborative tone. *Analysis voice* it's crucial to use but _only_ when you're not willing to change your mind.

## Body Language & Speech patterns
When trying to get across a message or communicating in general, there's the 7/38/55 rule: 7% content, 38% tone and 55% body language. Mind-blowing that content has so little weight.

<a name="creating-the-illusion-of-control"></a>
## Creating the illusion of control
Asking *why* feels accusatory. Instead, using *what* or *how* (e.g "how am I supposed to do that?"" or "what makes this necessary?""), comes out nicely and creates collaboration.

<a name="the-accusations-audit"></a>
## The accusations audit
During a tough conversation, it's better to put the 'elephant in the room' out there as soon as possible. Example: "I know you think I am an idiot and managed my way up with my family connections, but...". Unexpressed negative emotions never die, they're infections. that's why we want to clear the air as soon as possible and create empathy towards us.

<a name="the-value-of-no"></a>
## The value of no
During a negotiation, getting a *yes* is something that looks like the goal but the reality is that a *yes* without a *how* is useless. It's more useful to reverse the idea and get the other person to answer *no* and *how* they'll make it happen. A made up example made by me: "I need to know if is impossible for you to make an offer before the end of the day, otherwise I'll have to take other" might trigger a "No, we'll make the offer this morning before 12".

<a name="bending-reality"></a>
## Bending reality
Deadlines are rarely a hard deadline. Try to get the *truth* by bending *their* reality. Example: "Is it the end of the world if we don't meet the date?", or "what makes it so important to get it done by that day?". This feels to me like one of the most important skills for a developer...

<a name="bargaining"></a>
## Bargaining
 The 65-20-10 rule. You start a negotiation offering a number consisting of the 65% you want to pay for something. Before you do, you give a heads up of the number being very low and you have an emphatic attitude, almost apologetic. You then go a 20% more, aware that you're trying to make it better but letting the other person know you're getting to the max. Lastly, you increase a 10% more, which is less than in the previous increase, showing the other person that they've topped you out.

<a name="salary-negotiation"></a>
## Salary negotiation
The video is about a salary negotiation but it could be applied to any difficult conversation. 

I really like how starting with "I've got something that you aren't gonna want to hear, and probably you're going to think I'm a selfish person" warns the other person that this is a serious conversation and it should be taken as such. Then, explaining how you're willing to make your employer's life easier is a a great way to continue, ending with asking what would be fair for that position/responsibilities. Then, if is still not what you think you is fair, focus on what the company would lose if they don't make the deal (as in, you staying in your current position of moving somewhere else).

<a name="black-swans"></a>
## Black swans
Finding something unknown that will change everything during a negotiation. The only way to do this is to engage in conversation, keep and open mind and ask questions (remember to never use *why* but *what* or *how*)
